                    <p id="bio">Welcome to my professional hub! 
                    <br/>
                    As a results-driven communications and public relations expert with over 8 years of experience, I’ve built my career on pushing boundaries—whether it’s setting new industry standards or trailblazing revolutionary activations. As an effective team leader, I cultivate workplace cultures where creativity and collaboration drive success. When I’m not training my team or spearheading game-changing campaigns, I’m fueling powerhouse brands like Meta, adidas, X Games, Pabst Blue Ribbon, and Rockstar Games with fresh, visionary ideas and opportunities that keep them ahead of the curve.
                    <br/>
                    Let’s connect and see how we can make waves together!
